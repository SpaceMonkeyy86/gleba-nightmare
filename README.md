# Gleba Nightmare

This is a mod for Factorio which aims to significantly expand the Gleba experience, with an emphasis on difficulty. The player crashlands on Gleba instead of Nauvis and must build their factory from nothing, researching the entire Nauvis portion of the tech tree while simultaneously dealing with spoilage and overpowered pentapods. Additionally, many technologies have been made more expensive and require more types of science packs to research, so reaching space will require a much larger factory than what an experienced player would normally build.
